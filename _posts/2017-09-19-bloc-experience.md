title: My Experience at Bloc
---
In my other blog posts I've written a lot about my journey into coding and not a whole lot about Bloc and my overall experience so far. Prior to the start of the program I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of the curriculum and how I would be learning everything. I really like how Bloc eases you into the main curriculum by first teaching the command line and markdown. Bloc uses a variety of outside resources to teach concepts but two of the main resources, Code School and Codecademy, were used heavily to teach HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I really enjoy using both of these websites. Both do a great job explaining everything even to a beginning coder like myself.
One of the other ways Bloc teaches is through practice. There are a few projects throughout the course but the very first one was used as a walkthrough. I started by creating a static website using HTML and CSS. Then made the website responsive by adding javascript and then replacing that javacsript with jQuery. This was very helpful in reinforcing concepts I learned previously in the course and in teaching new javascript functions.
Looking back I'm actually very surprised with how much Bloc has been able to cover and the depth in which it has been covered. I feel I have leaned a lot and know I will continue to learn a lot throughout the course.
